# Trends and Suggested actions, copied from the notebook:


# Trends
* While men made up the bulk of the player base, women tended to spend a little more on average. 
* Nine out of ten of the most popular items cost more than the average item.
* The most profitable items tended to correlate with the most popular items; profitability in this case driven by number of purchases rather than base price.
* There are no 'whales' in the top spenders, that is, most of the money made on items comes from a diffuse player base, rather than a small number of users.
* The largest player base is in the 20-24 age range, while also seeing strong involvement from the 15-19 and 25-29 range.

# Suggested Actions
* At this time, growing the player base should be the main concern, as the bulk of profit is driven by infrequent purchases from many users.
    * Marketing targeted at women in their late teens and early twenties could help round out the player base. 
* Finding a way to reduce the overall number of items (starting with the least popular), or push the more popular ones, could result in more purchases.
    * With this strategy, an eye should be kept on the overall number of purchases to verify it remains steady or grows.
